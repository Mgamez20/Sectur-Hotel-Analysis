# Sectur-Hotel-Analysis
Tourist Arrival Analysis in Mexico (2019 and 2020)  

This analysis was created with data obtained from the Mexican Ministry of Tourism (*Secretar√≠a de Turismo*).
The main reason for this analysis was to compare the years 2019 and 2020 regarding hotel occupancy, the main cities visited by tourists and the average number of days that tourists stay in the different hotels in the cities they visit (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 stars) taking into account the difference in occupancy caused by COVID-19 in 2020.
